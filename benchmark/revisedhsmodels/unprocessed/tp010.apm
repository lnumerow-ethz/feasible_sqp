  Variables
    x[1] = -10
    x[2] =  10
    obj
  End Variables

  Equations
    (-3)*x[1]^2 + 2*x[1]*x[2] - x[2]^2 + 1 >= 0

    obj = x[1] - x[2]

    ! best known objective = -1
    ! begin of best known solution
    ! x[1] = 0
    ! x[2] = 1
    ! end of best known solution
  End Equations
End Model
