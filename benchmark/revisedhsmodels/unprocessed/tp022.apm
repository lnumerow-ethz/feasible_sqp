  Variables
    x[1] = 2
    x[2] = 2
    obj
  End Variables

  Equations
    (-1)*x[1] - x[2] + 2 >= 0
    (-1)*x[1]^2 + x[2] >= 0

    obj = (x[1] - 2)^2 + (x[2] - 1)^2

    ! best known objective = 1
    ! begin of best known solution
    ! x[1] = 1
    ! x[2] = 1
    ! end of best known solution
  End Equations
End Model
