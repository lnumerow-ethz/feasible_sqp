  Variables
    x[1] = -2, <= 1/2
    x[2] =  1
    obj
  End Variables

  Equations
    x[1]*x[2] - 1 >= 0
    x[1] + x[2]^2 >= 0

    obj = 100*(x[2] - x[1]^2)^2 + (1 - x[1])^2

    ! best known objective = 306.5
    ! begin of best known solution
    ! x[1] = 0.5
    ! x[2] = 2
    ! end of best known solution
  End Equations
End Model
