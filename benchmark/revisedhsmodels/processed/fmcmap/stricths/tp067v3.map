fmcTitle ("tp067v3"):

# Source version 1
# FMCMAP post processor version 1.1

# FMC's first native input language.
# The Hock & Schittkowski test problem #67.
# This is a free, more intuitive formulation of #67,
# without discontinuities, as it would probably be defined
# by a modeler of our days.
# The solution is equal to the one obtained with tp067v1,
# i.e., it is sensible but not exact in the sense of #67.
